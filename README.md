SimplePTT
=========

A Windows utility that enables global push-to-talk by muting and unmuting your microphone.

Default keys:
- Push-to-talk by holding: Caps-lock, [F13](http://www.grismar.net/ventrilocapsfix/) or Mouse4
- Toggle open mic/mute: Pause/Break button or the key next to 1

You can change the keybindings in MicController.cs

Extended by me to support:
- Open mic and push-to-talk simultanously
- Tray icon switches from grey (muted) to green (unmuted).
